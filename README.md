# 2D to 3D Style Transfer using Differentiable Neural Renderer

This is an implementation of the style transfer using the method outlined in "Neural 3D Mesh Renderer" (CVPR 2018) by Kato, Ushiku, and Harada.

# Requirements
See requirements.txt, but you also need pytorch with CUDA support. I used version 2.1.0 with the corresponding torchvision and torchaudio versions and CUDA 11.8, installed on Linux with 

`pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
